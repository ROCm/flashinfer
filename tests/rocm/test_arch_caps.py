"""Tests for flashinfer.rocm.arch_caps.

Deliberately GPU-free: every assertion here holds on any machine, so this file
protects the architectures we cannot physically test against as well as the one
we can. It is also *dependency*-free -- see the loader below -- which is what
lets it run as a hardware-less CI job on every pull request
(``.github/workflows/arch-caps-conformance.yml``).

# Load the modules under test without importing the `flashinfer` package.
#
# flashinfer/__init__.py ends in `raise RuntimeError("FlashInfer requires either
# CUDA or ROCm/HIP backend. Detected CPU-only PyTorch installation.")`, so
# `from flashinfer import arch_caps` needs a GPU-capable torch build even though
# nothing in this file touches a GPU or a tensor. Loading the two modules
# directly keeps the suite runnable with nothing installed but pytest.
#
# That is not merely a convenience. Both modules are torch-free at module scope
# *by contract* -- hip_utils sits on the pre-HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES path in
# tests/conftest.py, and arch_caps is imported by hip_utils -- and this loader
# makes the contract structural: if either grows a module-scope `import torch`,
# the conformance job stops being installable rather than quietly regressing.
#
# They reference each other relatively (hip_utils:10 at module scope,
# arch_caps:354 inside _live_versions), so they are registered under a synthetic
# package. Two unrelated top-level modules would leave those imports unresolvable
# and silently degrade _live_versions to its except-branch.
