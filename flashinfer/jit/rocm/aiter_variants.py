"""The AITER attention variants FlashInfer ``dlopen``s, and where they live.

The amd-aiter wheel prebuilds almost none of them, so AITER's lazy JIT builds
them at ``plan()`` time. This module enumerates the set so it can be built ahead
of time instead.

**Variants and builds are not one-to-one**: two bootstraps loop over
``return_lse`` internally and emit two files per call, so driving this table by
filename would run those builds twice into one directory -- hence :func:`builds`
alongside :func:`reachable_variants`.
