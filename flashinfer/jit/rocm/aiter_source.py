"""
Shared plumbing for FlashInfer's C++-level AITER backends (ROCm).

FlashInfer wraps AITER kernels by compiling a small ``csrc/rocm/*_aiter.cu`` shim
that calls AITER's C++ entry point directly and links the symbol-visible AITER
``.so``. Prefer ``#include``-ing AITER's real header, so a signature change is a
compile error rather than a load-time ``undefined symbol``. Fall back to a
forward declaration only for headers that still pull in pybind11, which clashes
with FlashInfer's ``-DPy_LIMITED_API`` build (``rope.h``, ``rmsnorm.h`` as of
0.1.16); there ``torch::Tensor`` is ``at::Tensor``, so the linker still resolves.

AITER's installed wheel builds its modules with ``-fvisibility=hidden``, so the
kernel symbols (e.g. ``rope_cached_positions_2c_fwd_impl``) are not linkable. This
helper rebuilds the needed AITER module once with ``AITER_SYMBOL_VISIBLE=1`` via
AITER's own ``aiter.jit.core.build_module`` (which also runs CK blob codegen for CK
ops), caches the result under FlashInfer's cache dir as ``lib<module>.so``, and
hands back the include/link flags for ``gen_jit_spec``.

A shim may link more than one AITER module (fused MoE needs both ``moe_sorting``
and a CK GEMM module), and a module may be built in a *specialized* form -- see
:class:`AiterModule`.

    The AITER shim libs live outside the JIT tree, under

    ``-L``/``-rpath`` on the link line. ``JitSpec.build()`` writes ``build.ninja``
    only when it is missing, so once a module has been built the recorded link
    line is never revisited -- the module keeps loading whichever AITER lib it
    was first built against, even after the resolved architecture changes.

    That is not a stale-build annoyance: the ``.so`` retains a RUNPATH into the
    old directory, so a module cached under ``.../gfx950/`` can go on loading a
    gfx942 library and **segfault**, and clearing ``FLASHINFER_ROCM_ARCH_LIST``
    or setting it correctly does not fix it. Only deleting the cache does.

    ``write_ninja`` funnels through ``write_if_different``, so this is free when
    nothing changed and rewrites exactly when the link line moves; ninja then
    relinks on its own.

    Only the JIT path is touched. An AOT-prebuilt module is loaded straight from
    ``aot_path`` and a ``FLASHINFER_DISABLE_JIT`` run raises before ninja is
    consulted, so in both cases the manifest has no reader and rewriting it would
    be pure filesystem noise.

    The write takes ``spec.lock_path`` -- the same lock ``JitSpec.build()`` holds
    while ninja runs -- because ``write_if_different`` truncates in place. Without
    it a concurrent builder (``pytest -n auto`` shares one JIT cache across
    processes) could have the manifest emptied under it mid-read.
