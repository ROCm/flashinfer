"""Per-architecture capability knowledge for the ROCm backends.

This module owns *which architectures are validated for which operations*.
That is deliberately distinct from :mod:`flashinfer.rocm.hip_utils`, which owns
*which architectures we compile for*, and from :mod:`flashinfer.rocm.aiter_utils`,
which owns *whether the AITER package is importable*.

.. important::
   Do not add a module-level ``import torch``; keep every torch import
   function-local.

   ``hip_utils`` imports this module at module scope, and ``hip_utils`` is used
   very early -- ``tests/conftest.py`` calls it to pick a GPU *before* pinning
   ``HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES``, and it must do so without touching the HIP runtime
   (hence its use of ``rocminfo`` rather than ``torch.cuda``). Staying torch-free
   is what keeps this module usable on that path.

    Deliberately *not* an ``ImportError``: a missing ``aiter`` package is a
    different condition from an unsupported architecture, and the import probes

    Deliberately *not* a :class:`flashinfer.utils.GPUArchitectureError` either,

    ``flashinfer/utils.py``, which imports torch at module scope, and this module

    rejected: a same-named copy is a different class, so ``except
