"""Build the AITER attention variants ahead of time, into FlashInfer's store.

Without this, the first ``plan()`` needing a missing variant pays an AITER
CK-tile compile -- 74-360s on gfx942 depending on the family, once per variant
(one ``.so`` serves every head dimension), and again after every container
restart that does not persist site-packages. On a read-only install it
does not stall, it fails, and ``backend="auto"`` silently drops to fa2.

    python -m flashinfer.rocm.prebuild_aiter_variants --list
    python -m flashinfer.rocm.prebuild_aiter_variants --arch gfx942
    python -m flashinfer.rocm.prebuild_aiter_variants --only mha_batch_prefill

**This needs a GPU.** The only supported way to make AITER emit a variant is to
call the op, which launches a kernel -- so it cannot be a ``docker build`` step
and has to run as a GPU-attached job whose output the image copies in.

One build at a time, deliberately. ``_aiter_env_scope`` mutates process-global
environment that AITER reads, so two concurrent builds in one process have the
first to finish restore the environment under the second. Parallelism belongs
across *processes*, each with its own environment.
