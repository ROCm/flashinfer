> AMD ROCm port of FlashInfer (`amd-flashinfer`), targeting gfx942/gfx950.
> The upstream CUDA repo at <https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer> uses
> different env vars, paths, and toolchains — its patterns don't apply here.

## CRITICAL: PR target

All PRs go to **`AMD-Ecosystem/flashinfer`**, base branch **`amd-integration`** — NEVER
to `flashinfer-ai/flashinfer` (the fork parent / true upstream). `gh pr create`
defaults the base to the fork parent, so always pass
`--repo AMD-Ecosystem/flashinfer --base amd-integration` explicitly, and run `gh repo set-default --view` first —
it MUST print `AMD-Ecosystem/flashinfer` or you abort. If the target owner cannot be
positively confirmed as `AMD-Ecosystem`, do not create the PR; stop and report why.
Failing to raise a PR is always preferable to raising one against upstream.

Also NEVER push to or raise a PR from the `amd-integration` branch itself — it
is the base, never the head. If you are on `amd-integration` with commits to
ship, create a fresh topic branch at the current HEAD
(`git branch <topic-branch>`), then run `git fetch origin amd-integration`
followed by `git reset --hard origin/amd-integration` to restore
`amd-integration` (the commits stay safe on `<topic-branch>`), and PR from
`<topic-branch>`. Treat a detached HEAD (empty `git branch --show-current`) as
an abort condition too.
Full procedure: `pr-workflow` skill.

## CRITICAL: work in a git worktree

Do branch work in a worktree at `tmp/worktrees/<branch-name>` and leave the main
checkout on `amd-integration`. Never switch the main checkout to a topic branch —
it owns the editable install and build artifacts, and switching it produces
stale-binary failures.

```bash
git worktree add -b <branch-name> tmp/worktrees/<branch-name> origin/amd-integration
```

A fresh worktree is source-only. Recreate both generated trees as **relative**
symlinks and copy `flashinfer/_version.py` from the main checkout, or the JIT
will not build:

```bash
rm -rf flashinfer/include flashinfer/csrc     # ln -f will not clear a real dir
ln -s ../include flashinfer/include
mkdir -p flashinfer/csrc && ln -s ../../csrc/rocm flashinfer/csrc/rocm
cp <main-checkout>/flashinfer/_version.py flashinfer/_version.py
```

`_version.py` only exists in the main checkout once it has been installed or
built. Details: `pr-workflow` skill.

## Installing Torch

Torch comes from the development image, not from pip. `repo.radeon.com`
publishes no `rocm-rel-` directory for ROCm 10.0, so there is no pip recipe
for the supported torch 2.12 at all — `docker/Dockerfile.rocm` takes it from
the `rocm/pytorch:rocm10.0_*` base image.

Do not raise torch to 2.13: it removes
`c10::impl::cow::materialize_cow_storage`, which every published `amd-aiter`
build's prebuilt prefill kernels link against.

If you ever install torch by hand on another stack, use `-f`
(`--find-links`) and **not** `--index-url` — that repo is a flat wheel
listing rather than a PEP 503 index. Pin the version: `-f` only adds to
PyPI, so an unpinned install can pick a CPU-only wheel. Verify with
`python -c "import torch; assert torch.version.hip, 'not a ROCm build'"`.

## Non-Obvious Gotchas

**JIT build.ninja caching**: `JitSpec.build()` only writes `build.ninja` when
the file is missing. Changing env vars (`FLASHINFER_ROCM_ARCH_LIST`, extra
cflags) is a **silent no-op** unless you call `spec.write_ninja()` first.

**`FLASHINFER_JIT_DEBUG=1` is a no-op on ROCm/HIP**: the env var is read in
[`flashinfer/jit/core.py`](flashinfer/jit/core.py) only on the `IS_CUDA` branch
(where it adds `-O0 -g -G`). The `IS_HIP` branch ignores it entirely. To get a
debug build on ROCm, append `"-O0", "-g"` via `extra_cuda_cflags` in the op's
JIT generator (the HIP path injects `-O3` before `extra_cuda_cflags`, so trailing
`-O0` is what actually overrides it on the hipcc command line) and clear
`~/.cache/flashinfer/`.

**Framework separation**: Torch headers **must not** be included in `include/`
files. `include/` is framework-agnostic (raw pointers only);
`csrc/rocm/` is where PyTorch tensor handling lives. Violations
cause subtle build failures.

**Test parallelism**: `pytest -n auto` automatically halves the physical GPU
count to avoid HSA/HIPBLAS flakiness under concurrent load. The `slow` marker
gates footprint, not runtime, and no CI job or script runs `-m slow` —
marking a test retires it, so do not reach for it to speed a lane up.

**A cold JIT cache dominates the suite**: 118 min cold against 10 min warm on
gfx950 at `-n 1`, so 92% of a first run is compilation. Clearing
`~/.cache/flashinfer` before timing anything makes the result meaningless.

**AITER is version-pinned.** The development image bundles the wheel, so no
separate install is needed there. `aiter_utils.AITER_MIN_VERSION` (0.1.20) is
the hard floor below which the vendored struct layouts stop matching, and
every 0.1.20 build is cp312 only — which is what fixes the interpreter.

```bash
pip install amd-aiter==0.1.20+rocm10.1.0a20260819.3135022 \
  --extra-index-url https://rocm.frameworks-nightlies.amd.com/whl-multi-arch/
```

Spell the version out in full including the local `+rocm...` segment; pip will
not select a local version from a loose specifier. `prefill.py` records
whatever is validated as `_AITER_LAST_VALIDATED`, and
[`docs/rocm/backends.md`](docs/rocm/backends.md) explains the index choice.

A source build (`git clone --recursive https://github.com/ROCm/aiter.git &&
cd aiter && python3 setup.py develop`) tracks master, which is **many releases
ahead of the pin with a different C ABI** — symbols the shim expects are
renamed, hidden rather than `extern "C"`, or absent. Nothing stops you running
one, but treat it as untested here.

That gap is a trap when working on the C++ shim: read the **installed** tree,
never a source checkout, before designing against an AITER symbol.

```bash
nm -D --defined-only -C <site-packages>/aiter/jit/module_<x>.so | grep '<fn>('
sed -n '/<fn>/,/;/p' <site-packages>/aiter_meta/csrc/include/<hdr>.h
```

Check availability in code: `from flashinfer.rocm.aiter_utils import is_aiter_supported`

**Bind AITER in C++, never through `aiter.ops.*` from the Python API.** Python
is for capability probes, JIT bootstrap, and backend routing; the call itself
belongs in `csrc/rocm/`. `mla.py` is the one remaining exception.

**Resolving a dispatcher symbol does not mean you get its arms.** AITER splits
one entry point across modules built with different flags: `aiter::mha_fwd`
tries asm then CK-Tile in source, but `module_mha_fwd` compiles `-DFAV2_ON=1`
only, and the asm arm lives in a separate `module_fmha_v3_fwd`
(`-DFAV3_ON=1 -DENABLE_CK=0`). Read `flags_extra_cc` before designing against
an arm, or the arg that selects it is a dead store:

```bash
python -c 'import aiter,json,os;d=os.path.dirname(aiter.__file__);print(json.load(open(d+"/jit/optCompilerConfig.json"))["module_mha_fwd"]["flags_extra_cc"])'
strings -a <variant>.so | grep -c fmha_fwd_v3    # 0 => the asm arm is not in this binary
```

## Arch ↔ codename

MI300X / MI325X = gfx942 = CDNA3; MI350X / MI355X = gfx950 = CDNA4.

External tuning references (CK, AITER, HipKittens) live in the
`benchmark-kernel` skill; PR/`gh` workflow details live in the `pr-workflow`
skill; the interactive plan-review workflow lives in the `plan-review` skill.

## Model Usage Policy

- **Plan Mode** (`/plan` or Shift+Tab): Always use `opus` at max effort for architecture decisions, system design, and multi-file analysis.
- **Agent / Agentic tasks**: Use `opus` at high effort when running multi-step autonomous tasks (bash commands, multi-file edits).
- **Edit / Implementation**: Use `sonnet` for routine code implementation, test writing, and refactoring once a plan is approved.
- **Quick tasks**: Use `sonnet` for Q&A, simple lookups, and documentation.

Switch model before starting each phase:
  /model opus     → for planning and agent runs
  /model sonnet   → for implementation and quick tasks
