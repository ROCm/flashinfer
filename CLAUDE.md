# CLAUDE.md

> AMD ROCm port of FlashInfer (`amd-flashinfer`), targeting gfx942/gfx950.
> The upstream CUDA repo at <https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer> uses
> different env vars, paths, and toolchains — its patterns don't apply here.

## Essential Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Install for development | `python -m pip install --no-build-isolation -ve.` |
| Run tests (fast) | `pytest -n auto --reruns 2 -m "not slow"` |
| Run all tests | `pytest -n auto --reruns 2` |
| Clear JIT cache | `rm -rf ~/.cache/flashinfer/` |
| Set target arch | `export FLASHINFER_ROCM_ARCH_LIST="gfx942,gfx950"` |
| Limit parallel build | `export MAX_JOBS=4` |
| Verbose JIT output | `export FLASHINFER_JIT_VERBOSE=1` |
| Run linting | `pre-commit run -a` |

## Installing Torch

Torch must come from AMD's ROCm repo via `--index-url` (not `-f`, which can
silently install a CPU-only wheel from PyPI). See the
[GPU, ROCm, and PyTorch Support](README.md#gpu-rocm-and-pytorch-support) table
in `README.md` for the version and command.

## Non-Obvious Gotchas

**JIT build.ninja caching**: `JitSpec.build()` only writes `build.ninja` when
the file is missing. Changing env vars (`FLASHINFER_ROCM_ARCH_LIST`, extra
cflags) is a **silent no-op** unless you call `spec.write_ninja()` first.

**`FLASHINFER_JIT_DEBUG=1` is a no-op on ROCm/HIP**: the env var is read in
[`flashinfer/jit/core.py`](flashinfer/jit/core.py) only on the `IS_CUDA` branch
(where it adds `-O0 -g -G`). The `IS_HIP` branch ignores it entirely. To get a
debug build on ROCm, append `"-O0", "-g"` via `extra_cuda_cflags` in the op's
JIT generator (the HIP path injects `-O3` before `extra_cuda_cflags`, so trailing
`-O0` is what actually overrides it on the hipcc command line) and clear
`~/.cache/flashinfer/`.

**Framework separation**: Torch headers **must not** be included in `include/`
files. `include/` is framework-agnostic (raw pointers only);
`flashinfer/csrc_rocm/` is where PyTorch tensor handling lives. Violations
cause subtle build failures.

**Test parallelism**: `pytest -n auto` automatically halves the physical GPU
count to avoid HSA/HIPBLAS flakiness under concurrent load. The `slow` marker
gates 1M-trial sampling and 4 GB tensor tests — exclude with `-m "not slow"`
for fast iteration.

**AITER is a separate install**: The AITER backend (used by prefill attention
on gfx942) is not bundled. Install from source:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ROCm/aiter.git
cd aiter && python3 setup.py develop
```

Check availability in code: `from flashinfer.aiter_utils import is_aiter_supported`

## Arch ↔ codename

MI300X / MI325X = gfx942 = CDNA3; MI350X = gfx950 = CDNA4.

External tuning references (CK, AITER, HipKittens) live in the
`benchmark-kernel` skill; PR/`gh` workflow details live in the `pr-workflow`
skill.
