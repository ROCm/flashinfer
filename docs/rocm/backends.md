# Backends on ROCm

FlashInfer+ROCm ships an in-tree HIP kernel for most ops and can dispatch
a subset to AMD's [AITER](https://github.com/ROCm/aiter). This page is the
long form of the support matrix in [README.md](../../README.md): what each
backend can do, what makes `backend="auto"` decline AITER, and the per-op
constraints that are easy to trip over.

## Choosing a backend

Four backend strings are accepted by the ops that take a `backend=`
argument. Which one names the in-tree kernel depends on the op:

| `backend=` | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `"auto"` (default) | Pick per call — see [below](#how-backendauto-resolves) |
| `"aiter"` | Require AITER; raise if the call is not compatible |
| `"fa2"` | The in-tree HIP kernel, for the attention wrappers (single/batch prefill and decode) |
| `"native"` | The in-tree HIP kernel, for everything else (`append_paged_kv_cache`, `rmsnorm`, `fused_add_rmsnorm`, `silu_and_mul`, `rope`) |

`mla` accepts only `"auto"` and `"aiter"` — there is no in-tree MLA kernel.

## Not available on ROCm

Some upstream modules wrap NVIDIA-only libraries or kernels. Importing one
raises `ImportError` naming the module, rather than exposing a stub that
fails later:

| Module | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| `flashinfer.gemm`, `flashinfer.grouped_mm`, `flashinfer.trtllm_low_latency_gemm` | CUTLASS / TensorRT-LLM GEMM kernels |
| `flashinfer.cudnn`, `flashinfer.attention` | cuDNN attention |
| `flashinfer.fp4_quantization`, `flashinfer.fp8_quantization`, and the same two under `flashinfer.quantization` | NVFP4 / trtllm-gen quantization |
| `flashinfer.fused_moe` | The upstream CUTLASS MoE. **ROCm has MoE** — use `flashinfer.aiter_fused_moe`, below |
| `flashinfer.dsv3_ops` | DeepSeek-V3 fusions built on the above |
| `flashinfer.comm.*` — `cuda_ipc`, `mixed_comm`, `mnnvl`, `nvshmem`, `nvshmem_allreduce`, `trtllm_alltoall`, `trtllm_ar`, `trtllm_mnnvl_ar`, `vllm_ar` | NVLink / NVSHMEM transports |
| `flashinfer.deep_gemm`, `flashinfer.green_ctx` | Both reach `flashinfer.cuda_utils`, which requires `cuda-python`; CUDA green contexts have no HIP analogue |
| `flashinfer.gdn_prefill`, `flashinfer.mamba.ssd_combined` | CuTe DSL — both import `cutlass` eagerly. The rest of `flashinfer.mamba` imports fine |
| `flashinfer.parallel_attention` | Needs `prefill.fmha_varlen`, upstream's CUTLASS varlen FMHA |
| `flashinfer.aot`, `flashinfer.__main__` | CUDA-only AOT build and CLI — they shell out to `nvcc`. **ROCm has AOT** — use `flashinfer.rocm.aot` |
| `flashinfer.tactics_blocklist_gen` | Enumerates CUDA backend tactics |

`importlib.util.find_spec` still reports these as present — the files ship,
the import is what is gated. Feature-detect with `hasattr(flashinfer, ...)`
or a `try: import ... except ImportError`, not `find_spec`.

A module that merely *imports* a gated one — `flashinfer.comm.trtllm_moe_alltoall`,
for instance — still fails, but transitively, so the error names the gated
dependency rather than the module you asked for. `flashinfer.cuda_utils` is
deliberately ungated: it is private, and the modules that reach it are listed
above.

`flashinfer.quantization`'s `packbits` and `segment_packbits` are unaffected
and have in-tree HIP kernels.

### Not ported yet: imports, but has no ROCm kernel

Gating is not the whole story. These import cleanly and fail on first call,
while resolving or building their JIT sources, naming the file that does not
exist. Usually that surfaces from ninja:

```text
ninja: error: '.../csrc/rocm/topk.cu', needed by '.../topk.cuda.o', missing
```

* `flashinfer.topk`, `flashinfer.concat_ops` and `flashinfer.mhc` — ordinary
  kernels with no `csrc/rocm` source.
* `flashinfer.topk_varlen` — its optimized backends admit only NVIDIA compute
  capabilities and the general fallback calls `get_topk_module()`, so no path
  is available.
* `flashinfer.mamba`'s `selective_state_update` and `checkpointing_ssu`. Its
  `ssd_combined` is gated instead: it imports `cutlass` eagerly and so never
  reaches a kernel.
* `flashinfer.kda_prefill` and the `flashinfer.kda_kernels` entry points —
  `csrc/rocm` has no `kda/` tree. `flashinfer.kda` does not even import, for
  want of `tvm_ffi`, which the image does not ship.
* `flashinfer.diffusion_ops` — it re-exports four fused DiT entry points from
  `flashinfer.norm`, and `csrc/rocm/norm.cu` defines none of them.
* `flashinfer.trace.templates.gemm`, through the `nv_internal` FP4 sources.
* Three side paths of otherwise supported modules: `utils.set_log_level()`,
  the opt-in GPU stats counter in `api_logging`, and `norm`'s fused
  rmsnorm+silu variant.

They stay importable because working code reaches them — `topk_varlen` imports
`topk` at module scope — so gating would break more than it documents.

Some fail earlier, as a plain `FileNotFoundError`: the Mamba generators open
their templates directly, and fused rmsnorm+silu copies its source before any
build starts.

`tests/rocm/test_kernel_source_coverage.py` holds this list. It fails when a
newly vendored op names a kernel source absent from `csrc/rocm`, so the set
above cannot grow unnoticed.

### NVIDIA-only, but not gated

These import cleanly and fail only when called, so the gate never sees them —
but a ROCm equivalent would be a rewrite, not a port:

* `flashinfer.cute_dsl` and `flashinfer.cutile` — CuTe DSL. Neither fails on
  call: `cute_dsl/__init__.py:37` imports its kernels only when
  `is_cute_dsl_available()`, so on ROCm the module offers its availability
  helpers and no kernels, and `cutile` exports `is_cuda_tile_available()`
  alone, which answers `False`. Probe those rather than the import.
* `flashinfer.msa_ops` and `flashinfer.moe_ep` — `cutlass.cute` plus, for
  `moe_ep`, NVSHMEM.
* `flashinfer.gdn_decode` — every kernel under `gdn_kernels/` is `@cute.jit`.
  It imports and fails when called, where `gdn_prefill` reaches `import
  cutlass` at module scope and is gated in the table above instead.
* `flashinfer.nvfp4_attention_sm120` — `supported_compute_capability([120, 121])`.
* `flashinfer.xqa` — `csrc/xqa/{mma.cuh,gmma.cuh,gmma_impl.cuh,tma.h}` emit
  NVIDIA PTX directly (`mma.sync`, `wgmma`, `cp.async.bulk`), so an AMD path is
  a rewrite rather than a port.
* `flashinfer.tllm_utils` — `delay_kernel()` builds five `nv_internal`
  TensorRT-LLM sources. `flashinfer.autotuner` imports the module, which is why
  it is not gated.

### Blocked on a missing package, not on ROCm

`flashinfer.profiler` needs `tg4perfetto` and `flashinfer.artifacts` needs
`requests`; `docker/Dockerfile.rocm` ships neither, so neither imports here.
That says nothing about their ROCm support either way.

## Installing AITER

Unless you are using the prebuilt Docker image, AITER is a separate
install. `amd-aiter` is **not** on the top-level `pypi.amd.com/simple`
index, and the ROCm-versioned channels carry no wheel at or above the
supported floor, so install from the nightlies index:

```bash
pip install amd-aiter==0.1.20+rocm10.1.0a20260819.3135022 \
  --extra-index-url https://rocm.frameworks-nightlies.amd.com/whl-multi-arch/
```

Use `--extra-index-url`, not `--index-url`, so AITER's own dependencies
still resolve from PyPI, and spell the version out in full including the
local `+rocm...` segment — pip will not select a local version from a loose
specifier. Check afterwards that the install did not pull a CPU-only torch
over your ROCm one: `python -c "import torch; assert torch.version.hip"`.

**`aiter_utils.AITER_MIN_VERSION` (0.1.20) is a hard floor**, enforced
before routing. FlashInfer links AITER's C++ symbols by mangled name
(`csrc/rocm/aiter_loader.cc`) and vendors its argument structs
(`include/flashinfer/rocm/attention/aiter/`) at the 0.1.20 layout, so an older
release shifts field offsets instead of failing to load -- and 0.1.20 renamed
the RMSNorm entry points, so an older one cannot resolve them. Below the floor
`auto` will not select AITER and an explicit `backend="aiter"` raises.

The development image (`docker/Dockerfile.rocm`) bundles that wheel, on
CPython 3.12, and needs no separate install -- it is the one supported
configuration, so in practice this section is only for someone assembling
their own.

Every 0.1.20 wheel is cp312 only, which is what fixes the interpreter. None
is built against ROCm 10.0 directly; the pin above is the nearest retarget
of the same source revision (build id `3135022`).

A source build tracks master, which is many releases ahead of the pin
**with a different C ABI** — symbols the shim expects are renamed, hidden
rather than `extern "C"`, or absent:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ROCm/aiter.git
cd aiter && python3 setup.py develop
```

Nothing stops you running one, but treat it as untested here.

### C++-level integration

The `rmsnorm`, `fused_add_rmsnorm`, `silu_and_mul`, and `rope`
(cos/sin-cache) AITER backends are integrated at the **C++ level**: the
JIT compiles a small HIP shim that calls AITER's C++ kernels
(`aiter::rmsnorm`, `aiter::add_rmsnorm`, `aiter::silu_and_mul`,
`rope_cached_positions_2c_fwd_impl`) and links a symbol-visible AITER
`.so`. There is no runtime `import aiter` on these paths.

The first JIT build of each op builds the corresponding AITER module once
with `AITER_SYMBOL_VISIBLE=1` and caches it under
`~/.cache/flashinfer/aiter_libs/`. The `module_rmsnorm_quant` build is large
and can take many minutes the first time.

### `mha_fwd` ships no prebuilt kernels at all

AITER ships prebuilt `mha_varlen_fwd_*.so` files and no `mha_fwd*` — only
`mha_fwd_kernels.cu` source. Single prefill is the op that routes through the
non-varlen `mha_fwd` template (batch=1 needs no seqstart plumbing, see
[PR 246](https://github.com/AMD-Ecosystem/flashinfer/pull/246)), so **every**
one of its `(dtype, needs_mask, has_lse)` variants JIT-builds on first call. `needs_mask` is `causal or window_left >= 0`: AITER
splits that `.so` on whether anything is masked, not on causality.

**Absence of `mha_fwd*.so` is expected, not a broken install.** AITER
prebuilds what vLLM and SGLang call, which is the varlen path; the
non-varlen variant space is not in that set.

The shipped varlen set is not full coverage either, so this is a difference
of degree rather than a unique case: batch prefill lazily builds whichever
varlen variants are missing. Single prefill builds every variant; batch
prefill builds the gaps.

Two consequences worth planning for:

* Budget **20+ minutes** for a cold variant. This is the same first-build
  cost as the C++ AITER modules above, not a separate surprise.
* A read-only or foreign-owned `site-packages/aiter/jit/` lets the build
  succeed but the install step fail. That error currently propagates out of
  `backend="auto"` instead of falling back to `fa2`.

## How `backend="auto"` resolves

There are three policies. Which one applies is a property of the op, not of
the call:

| Policy | Ops |
| :--- | :--- |
| AITER when the call is compatible, else the in-tree kernel | `single_prefill`, `batch_prefill`, `batch_decode` |
| Always the in-tree `native` kernel — AITER is opt-in | `rmsnorm`, `fused_add_rmsnorm`, `silu_and_mul`, `rope`, `append_paged_kv_cache` |
| AITER only — no HIP kernel exists | `mla` |

`single_decode_with_kv_cache` (HIP-only) and `aiter_fused_moe`
(AITER-only) take no `backend=` argument at all.

When `auto` declines AITER for the attention ops it falls back to the
in-tree kernel and usually warns once with the reason. A few `batch_decode`
short-circuits (CUDA-graph capture without a declared `max_seq_len`,
`use_tensor_cores=True`) fall back silently. The always-native ops make no per-call decision, so they neither
warn nor report a reason.

The "always native" ops are that way because measurement said so,
not because AITER is unavailable:

* **`append_paged_kv_cache`** — AITER's `reshape_and_cache_flash` is
  bit-exact against the in-tree kernel but sustains 2.86 TB/s to its 3.62
  on identical work (gfx942, nnz=262144). Explicit `backend="aiter"`
  additionally requires fp16/bf16 and `NHD`.
* **`silu_and_mul`** and **`rope`** (cos/sin-cache) — the in-tree kernel
  was the better default in experiment. The AITER C++ path is reachable
  only via an explicit `backend="aiter"`.
* **`rmsnorm`** and **`fused_add_rmsnorm`** — at every 8-aligned
  `hidden_size`, AITER won 0 of 230 configs on gfx942 and 0 of 226 on
  gfx950. `fused_add_rmsnorm` is 1.6-1.8x slower, because CK cannot alias
  its output onto its input and the shim must stage two extra buffers on a
  bandwidth-bound kernel; `rmsnorm` is level on speed and less accurate.
  AITER does win up to 2x at `hidden_size` 111 and 500, where the native
  kernel's `vec_size` (`gcd(16/sizeof(T), d)`) collapses to 1 or 4 — but no
  model uses those widths, and the win is absent on gfx942 for the shapes
  where gfx950 shows it. Re-run with
  `python benchmarks/rocm/bench_norm.py --aa` for the noise floor
  and then without `--aa`; read the A/A first, since a margin inside it is
  not a result.

## CUDA-only arguments

The decode, prefill and MLA wrappers declare upstream's full parameter list, in
upstream's order, so a caller written against the CUDA API binds correctly and
an argument left at its default costs nothing. An argument that actually asks
for a CUDA feature — NVFP4 KV-cache scale factors, trtllm-gen skip-softmax, the
split-KV scheduler knobs, CUDA-graph MLA capture — raises `NotImplementedError`
naming itself rather than being ignored. A value that means "not requested"
(`False` for an enable flag, `1.0` for a calibration scale) is accepted.

`q_scale`, `k_scale` and `v_scale` are *not* in that set: every attention entry
point folds them into `sm_scale` and the output.

`CUDA_ONLY_PARAMS` in `scripts/rocm_api_parity.py` is the full list. The script
also fails on any undeclared signature divergence from upstream — a missing
parameter, a reordered one, or a drifted default; `tests/rocm/test_api_parity.py`
runs it in CI.

## Known limitations

AITER constraints fall into two groups. The first errors out under
`backend="aiter"` and triggers fallback under `backend="auto"`. The second
is worse: the call runs, but the flag is silently dropped.

`append_paged_kv_cache` sits outside both — its `auto` already resolves to
`native`, so there is no fallback to trigger, and none of the ignored
kwargs below are parameters of it.

### Falls back to the in-tree kernel under `auto`, raises under `aiter`

* GPU is not gfx942 or gfx950
* `kv_layout` is not `NHD`
* a custom attention mask tensor is supplied
* `q_dtype` is not `float16` / `bfloat16` (no fp32, fp8, or int8)
* `q_dtype != kv_dtype` — mixed-precision Q/KV is unsupported
* `head_dim_qk != head_dim_vo` (e.g. DeepSeek-style MLA with 192/128)
* `pos_encoding_mode != "NONE"` — AITER attention supports only `"NONE"`
* batch decode: `use_tensor_cores=True`, or `use_cuda_graph=True` without a
  declared `max_seq_len`
* the `aiter` Python package is not importable

### Accepted but not honoured

These kwargs are accepted by the wrapper and never reach the kernel, so
passing them can produce **wrong results**. Switching to the in-tree
backend fixes only the first group.

**Dropped on the AITER path; pass `backend="fa2"` if you need them:**

* attention sinks (`sinks`)
* FP8 dequant scales (`scale_q` / `scale_k` / `scale_v`)
* `use_fp16_qk_reduction`
* RoPE scaling kwargs (`rope_scale`, `rope_theta`) — only meaningful
  alongside `pos_encoding_mode != "NONE"`, which AITER attention rejects
  outright, so in practice they pass through when the mode is `"NONE"`

**Dropped on *both* ROCm paths — there is no backend that honours them.**
These at least log a warning rather than failing silently:

* `enable_pdl`
* multi-modal / prefix-cache helpers (`maybe_prefix_len_ptr`,
  `maybe_token_pos_in_items_ptr`, `maybe_max_item_len_ptr`)

ALiBi is not in either list: `maybe_alibi_slopes` is filled internally
from the head count, and the user-facing route to it is
`pos_encoding_mode="ALIBI"`, which raises on the AITER path rather than
being ignored.

## Per-op notes

### Soft-capped causal prefill avoids one AITER kernel

AITER's
`mha_varlen_fwd` miscomputes `logits_soft_cap` for causal prefill at
`head_dim=128` (through amd-aiter 0.1.21) — on **gfx950 only**, and there at
every length, so which architectures are affected lives in `arch_caps.py`
rather than at the call sites. Single and ragged prefill always dispatch
through that kernel, so on gfx950 `auto` serves them with `fa2` and
`backend="aiter"` raises rather than returning wrong numbers. gfx942 measures
clean over a `qo_len` × `kv_len` sweep at every cap and uses AITER as normal.

Paged prefill keeps AITER at a native page size, since that route takes
`mha_batch_prefill` instead — measured exact on amd-aiter 0.1.20 against an
fp32 reference on both architectures — and falls back only when the run-time
probe demotes it to a flat gather. Every other soft-cap shape is unaffected.

### `fused_add_rmsnorm` and `gemma_fused_add_rmsnorm` at large `hidden_size`

The `native` fused kernels stage the fp32 row in shared memory, costing
`hidden_size` floats. Above 16352 on gfx942 (40928 on gfx950) that exceeds the
per-block limit, so the kernel re-reads the row from `residual` instead — one
extra dtype round-trip of precision, on those sizes only.

Both `fused_add_rmsnorm` and `gemma_fused_add_rmsnorm` always take this path
above the threshold: the Gemma variant has no `backend=` argument, and
`fused_add_rmsnorm` now resolves `auto` to native. Only an explicit
`backend="aiter"` avoids it.

### Batch prefill: page size and the flat-gather path

AITER's CK FMHA kernels natively serve page sizes `{1, 16, 1024}` — the same
set for fp16, bf16 and fp8, measured by sweeping the kernel itself. Other sizes
still work but go through an extra GPU gather that flattens the paged KV cache
before the AITER call — inside the timed region, which matters when
benchmarking.

**Being able to serve a page size natively is not a reason to.** For fp16 and
bf16 the gather measured equal to or faster than the native kernel at every
batch size, so `auto` keeps them on it and reaches for native paging only at
page size 1024. fp8 is the exception: its flat-gather route would be
`mha_varlen_fwd`, which has no fp8 kernel, so fp8 always takes native paging.

That list is a starting point, not a guarantee. `plan()` confirms it by
building the kernel, and a page size the installed AITER cannot actually
serve also falls back to the gather with a warning naming the reason.
Builds installed from an AITER source commit (as SGLang and vLLM do) are
the usual case where a "native" page size is rejected.

Set `FLASHINFER_AITER_STRICT=1` to raise instead of falling back — useful
in CI, where a silent slowdown is easy to absorb and hard to notice.

Ragged (non-paged) batch prefill is supported through
`BatchPrefillWithRaggedKVCacheWrapper`, with the same auto-routing rules.

### Batch decode: CUDA-graph capture

AITER's launch grid and `.so` variant are fixed at capture time, so the
contract depends on whether you declare a capacity.

Without `max_seq_len`, graph capture is opt-in via an explicit
`backend="aiter"` and you must **capture at your maximum sequence length**:
the kernel early-exits per sequence on `context_lens`, so replays *shorter*
than captured are correct but *longer* ones are not. `auto` stays on `fa2`.

Passing `max_seq_len` to the wrapper sizes the grid, `.so` variant and
partition workspace from that capacity instead, so a graph captured at any
shape replays for any `seq_len <= max_seq_len` — the same capacity-based
contract `fa2` has, which is what lets `auto` select AITER under capture.

Two caveats. The partition workspace scales with the declared capacity, so
an over-generous value costs memory on every `run()`. And the capacity is
enforced in `plan()`: a replay that writes the persistent buffers directly
is not checked, and an over-length sequence there is silently truncated to
the capacity rather than attending to its full context.

`run(..., return_lse=True)` raises on this backend under capture — PA v1
emits no LSE and the FA2 shadow plan it borrows is not capture-safe.

Multi-token decode (`q_len_per_req > 1`) raises `NotImplementedError` on
ROCm regardless of backend, as does an output dtype that differs from the
query dtype.

### MLA

* `use_cuda_graph=True` and `run(..., return_lse=True)` both raise
  `NotImplementedError` — neither is supported on the AITER MLA path.
* `q_data_type` must be `float16` or `bfloat16`, and must equal
  `kv_data_type`.
* `page_size` is not restricted by the code, but only `page_size=1` is
  covered by the numerical tests. Treat anything larger as unverified.
* `plan(causal=False)` **raises** when `max_seqlen_q > 1`. AITER's
  `mla_prefill_fwd` has no causal flag and unconditionally dispatches the
  causal ASM kernel, so honouring `causal=False` would silently return
  causal results. This is a deliberate divergence from the CUDA wrapper,
  which does honour it.
* `run()` hands AITER a zero-copy view when `ckv_cache` and `kpe_cache`
  are adjacent halves of one allocation (the vLLM / SGLang layout).
  Otherwise it builds the combined cache with `torch.cat` on every call
  and warns once *per wrapper* — a 60-layer model with a wrapper per layer
  emits 60 warnings. 4-D caches are rejected outright.

### Fused MoE

`flashinfer.aiter_fused_moe` is AITER-only — there is no HIP MoE kernel.

```python
from flashinfer import aiter_fused_moe, shuffle_moe_weight

w1s = shuffle_moe_weight(w1)
w2s = shuffle_moe_weight(w2)
out = aiter_fused_moe(hidden_states, w1s, w2s, topk_ids, topk_weights)
```

* `hidden_states` must be `bfloat16` or `float16` — fp8 activations are
  rejected; the shim quantizes per token itself.
* The **weights** may be fp8, matching `hidden_states` otherwise. fp8 needs
  both `w1_scale` and `w2_scale` (neither alone) and two shape constraints,
  not one: `model_dim % 128 == 0` (CK steps stage-1 K by 128 on every tile
  and both architectures, so no `block_m` rescues it), **and** `inter_dim`
  divisible by the stage-2 K tile, which depends on `block_m` and the
  architecture. With `block_m="auto"` the shim tries the other legal tiles
  before giving up; pin `block_m` and an indivisible `inter_dim` raises.
  **The fp8 encoding is architecture-dependent** — `float8_e4m3fnuz` on
  gfx942, `float8_e4m3fn` on gfx950. Ask `moe_fp8_dtype()` rather than
  hard-coding one; the shim raises `ValueError` on the wrong encoding, which
  is what stops the hardware reinterpreting the bits.
* `activation` is `"silu"` or `"gelu"`. `block_m` is the CK tile height —
  32, 64, or 128, or `"auto"` (the default), which picks from the expected
  tokens *per expert*, not the total token count.
* `topk_ids` is int32 in `[0, num_experts)` — there is no drop marker.
  `topk_weights` is float32.
* **Weights must be pre-shuffled** with `shuffle_moe_weight`, which lays
  them out for the 16x16 MFMA tile. Passing unshuffled weights does not
  raise: shape and dtype are unchanged, so nothing can detect it, and the
  output is silently wrong.

### No AITER backend

These take the in-tree HIP kernel. Cascade is listed first because it is the
partial case — its own kernels are HIP, but what it calls is not:

* **Cascade attention** — the *merge* kernels only.
  `FLASHINFER_HIP_FUSED_CASCADE=1` narrows to `MultiLevelCascadeAttentionWrapper`:
  it passes each level's partial state into the next prefill call rather than
  merging afterwards. A level that resolves to AITER still merges post-hoc --
  the AITER kernel takes no partial state -- and the two shared-prefix wrappers
  never consult the flag. Opt-in, both paths tested, read once at import. **The attention underneath is not HIP-only**: each of the
  three wrappers builds an ordinary entry point internally at
  `backend="auto"` — `BatchPrefillWithPagedKVCacheWrapper` for the
  multi-level and shared-prefix-prefill wrappers,
  `BatchDecodeWithPagedKVCacheWrapper` plus `single_prefill_with_kv_cache`
  for the shared-prefix decode one — so each level routes to AITER whenever
  a plain call of that shape would. Measured: a two-level
  `MultiLevelCascadeAttentionWrapper.plan()` at page_size 128 resolves both
  levels to `aiter`. None of the three takes a `backend=` argument, so
  there is no supported way to pin the levels to `fa2` short of the
  capability table declining AITER.
* **POD attention** — `PODWithPagedKVCacheWrapper` and
  `BatchPODWithPagedKVCacheWrapper`. JIT-only, excluded from AOT builds,
  matching upstream CUDA.
* **LayerNorm / Gemma RMSNorm**, **sampling** (Top-K / Top-P / Min-P /
  OnlineSoftmax / SamplingFromLogits), the **logits processor** pipeline,
  and **quantization** (`packbits`, `segment_packbits`).

### fp8 on the HIP path

* Batch decode accepts an fp8 KV-cache (`float8_e4m3fnuz`).
* RoPE has a fused RoPE + fp8-quantize + paged-KV-append path covering
  `float8_e4m3fnuz` and `float8_e5m2fnuz`, alongside LLaMA and LLaMA 3.1
  scaling.

### fp8 on the AITER path: paged prefill only

`BatchPrefillWithPagedKVCacheWrapper` serves an fp8 query and KV cache, at
**1.22-1.66x** over bf16 through the wrapper (gfx942, page size 16, GQA 32/8,
causal). Four constraints, all of them AITER's:

* **Output is bf16**, whatever the query dtype — there is no fp8-output kernel.
  `plan()` defaults `o_data_type` accordingly and rejects anything else.
* **Descales are required and must be per-tensor** — a single float32 each for
  `scale_q`, `scale_k`, `scale_v`, passed to `run()`. AITER reads element 0 of
  whatever it is given, so a per-head tensor would silently apply head 0's scale
  to every head; the shim rejects it instead.
* **`return_lse` is unavailable.** AITER builds no LSE instance of the fp8
  kernel at any page size, so it raises rather than degrading.
* Every other prefill route — single, ragged, and the paged flat-gather path —
  reaches `mha_fwd`/`mha_varlen_fwd`, which have no fp8 kernel. Those raise
  `NotImplementedError` naming fp8; the in-tree fa2 kernel rejects 8-bit types
  in a `static_assert`, which would otherwise surface as a compiler log.

## Tests

Every row in the README matrix is covered by the default `pytest`
selection (`testpaths` in `pyproject.toml`). Most have a matching
`tests/rocm/test_*.py`. Two are covered from elsewhere:
`single_decode` from `test_batch_decode_kernels.py`,
`test_sliding_window.py`, and `test_logits_cap.py`; `quantization`
(`packbits`, `segment_packbits`) from `tests/utils/test_quantization.py`,
which is shared with the CUDA suite rather than ROCm-specific.
